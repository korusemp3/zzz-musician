## 3. Color Rules

- Red is used ONLY for:
  - Buttons
  - Active states

- Cyan is used minimally (signal highlights only).

- Background must never be pure black.
- Always use subtle noise overlay.
- No colorful gradients across entire layout.
- No pastel tones.

## 4. UI Philosophy

- Large rounded corners (ZZZ feel)
- Soft glass panels
- Thin borders with low opacity
- Subtle depth, no heavy drop shadows
- Interface should feel layered

- Flickering animations everywhere
- Over-saturated neon
